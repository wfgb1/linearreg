# House Prices vs. Square Footage

This project analyzes the relationship between house prices and square footage using Python data science tools. The notebook, exported as an HTML file, provides an exploratory analysis and modeling exercise to assess how well square footage predicts house price.

## Project Overview

The notebook covers:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with scatter plots
- Fitting a linear regression model
- Visualizing the regression line and residuals
- Model evaluation and insights

## Objective

To understand how square footage influences house prices, and to model this relationship using simple linear regression. This helps determine whether square footage is a reliable predictor of home value.
